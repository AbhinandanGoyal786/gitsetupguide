If u want to create a new branch then follow below steps:
1)Open Git Bash.
2)For Create New branch using this command.
	git checkout -b new_branch_name
does not touch your local changes. 
It just creates the branch from the current HEAD and sets the HEAD there. So I guess that's what you want.
3)if u want to any change /add file/ delete file in branch then do it with same procedure. and commit it into branch.
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push origin new_branch_name
